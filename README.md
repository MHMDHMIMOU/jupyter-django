# Using Jupyter Notebook with Django

These are the notebooks used for my presentation at the [Django Boston meetup](https://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/237297349/).
On GitHub, view any of the `.ipynb` files to see a rendered version.
Alternatively, clone the repo, and view the contents of the `html` directory in a web browser.
